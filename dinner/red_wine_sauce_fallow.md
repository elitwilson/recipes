## Instructions

1. **Sauté shallots:** In a heavy-based pan, melt a small knob of butter and gently sauté the minced shallots until soft and translucent (about 3-4 minutes).
2. **Bloom tomato paste:** Add tomato paste and cook for about 1 minute until it darkens slightly. This removes the raw taste and builds depth.
3. **Reduce wine:** Deglaze with wine (and port if using). Bring to a boil and reduce by half. You're looking for it to coat the back of a spoon.
4. **Add stock:** Add 2 beef stock reduction cubes. Whisk until melted and fully incorporated. Let it simmer for 2-3 minutes.
5. **Finish:** Add the fresh parsley and tarragon, followed by the cold butter. Whisk constantly to emulsify the butter into the sauce.
6. **Infuse and strain:** Let the herbs infuse for 1-2 minutes, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve.
7. **Serve:** Serve immediately with your beef wellington.

## Notes

**Make Ahead:**
- Prepare through step 4 (reduce wine, add stock cubes)
- Cool and refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days
- Day of serving: Reheat gently over low heat, then add the fresh herbs and whisk in the cold butter just before serving

**Why tomato paste:**
- Adds body, umami, and natural pectin that helps the sauce hold together
- Pure wine reductions can be thin and one-dimensional; tomato paste gives it structure
