## Results Log

### v1.1.0 - 2025-01-19
- **Changes**: 
  - Rice: 330g → 275g (v1.0.0 was too much for 2 people)
  - Sauce: 33g each of soy sauce, mirin, sake; 16.5g brown sugar
  - Method: pan seared thighs in non-stick, poured sauce in to reduce
- **Flavor**: Pretty good, sweet
- **Texture/Consistency**: Sauce didn't reduce to syrupy consistency as wanted
- **Issues**: 
  - 330g rice was too much for 2 people, threw the rest away - wasn't enough left for fried rice
  - Sauce never reduced to desired consistency when added to pan after searing
- **Next**: TBD
